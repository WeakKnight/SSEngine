Gameplay:

This is a shooting game.
You control a player(Green box), use A,W,S,D to move around (The movement is controlled by physics force simulation)
There are in total 10 enemies in the game screen(Red Box), their movement is controlled by physics and they will move toward you constantly.
You can press "J" to shoot bullets, bullets's movement is controlled by physics, too. Bullet can hit enemies and do 1 damage

The enemies will try to hit with you, each hit will do 1 damage to you.

You have 2 HP and each other enemy has 2 HP. You will die until you lose all HP.

Most of the game data is drived by lua scripts in  Game/Data/

I will try to add win screen and lose screen as soon as possible.
